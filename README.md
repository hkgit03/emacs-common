# emacs-common

Common things used by all my [Ebox](https://github.com/laerling/ebox)-managed Emacs distributions.

This repository is not called `emacs`, for obvious reasons.
Clone with `git clone https://github.com/laerling/emacs-common ~/emacs`, because that's the directory which Ebox uses by default.
